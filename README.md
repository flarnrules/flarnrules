# hello github!

- I am flarnrules
- I am building a blockchain ecosystem called Flarnchain
- This task, which I started in February 2021... is a fairly complex task.
- There are elements of almost every single facet of the human experience involved in designing and working towards the deployment of a unique blockchain ecosystem.
- Blockchains, at least in the Cosmos Network, are "Replicated State Machines", which are esssentially these sort of nebulous unkillable operating systems.
- They exist as full, Turing complete, operating systems - that are open to the public.
- When I think of an operating system, the first few words that come to mind are: Windows, MacOS, and Linux. These are operating systems.
    - To use operating systems, we need to have a computer.
    - A computer is a 'state machine'
    - Some computers, like the machine that I'm using right now, are physical things. They exist in the reality where we can reach out and touch them.
    - Other computers, like Virtual Machines or VMs can exist inside our computers.
    - Cloud VMs exist inside other people's computers, but can run an instance on our machine.
    - Like remotely piloting a drone, but for a computer!
    - Replicated State Machines, exist on multiple computers... simultaneously.
    - Like a cluster (which is essentially multiple cloud VMs).
    - But different from a cluster (A single entity is in charge of this group of VMs)
    - A Replicated State Machine is controlled by multiple agents, each with their own incentives.
    - The software level of a Replicated State Machine is updated based on a collective... group of decision makers, where the ability to be one of those decision makers is 100% permissionless, resulting in a sort of pvp combined with pve game theory.

- I am learning web design and trying to learn software development
- I'm currently in the W3 Builder's Alliance Q1 2023 cohort. // did not complete my capstone project "Sentry Nodes" but learned a lot, and progressed "Sentry Nodes" along significantly.
- Learning smart contracts in Rust // have not written any smart contracts, in Rust, but I have devised a few ideas!
- Learning Rust, CosmWasm // these are two totally different things. Rust is a systems programming language. CosmWasm is a framework for cosmos SDK based blockchain smart contracts, that use webassembly for deployment on blockchains. Even that is not quite correct.
- Realizing that 

## Current learning path:
- Harvard CS50x (computer science ~ general)
- The Odin Project (web development)
- Web3 Builder's Alliance Q1 2023 cohort (smart contracts written in Rust)


## Current education books:
- Learn Python in one day and LEARN IT WELL (50% complete)
- The Rust Programming Language (10% complete)
- Invent Your Own Computer Games With Python (0% complete)

## Websites:
- https://www.flarnchain.com -> built with Wix.
- https://flarnrules.github.io/odin-recipes/ -> built from scratch with HTML only.

## Setup:
- Windows Subsystem for Linux on Windows 11
- Running Ubuntu, using Windows terminal as base terminal and BASH for CLI
- VS Code for text editing
- Learning VIM / Neovim

## Newsletter:
- The Flarnchain Newsletter
- Sign up here: https://www.flarnchain.com/
- Published weekly on Wednesday since February 2021.
- Documents my journey of investing, investigating, and building in the crypto/web3 space.

## Projects:
- Flarncards (nft project, currently on WAX blockchain)
- Sentry Nodes (nft project, to be deployed on Stargaze blockchain)
- Flarncoin (multi-chain cryptocurrency, TBD)
- Flarnchain (blockchain built with cosmos SDK, TBD)
